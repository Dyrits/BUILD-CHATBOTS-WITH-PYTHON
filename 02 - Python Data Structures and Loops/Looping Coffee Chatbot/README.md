### Description (by [code]cademy / PRO)
When in doubt, drink more coffee!

In the previous Coffee Chatbot project, you learned to build a Python chatbot for ordering one cup of coffee by leveraging recursive functions, user inputs, and print statements. The solution code from that project is carried over here. Now, it’s time to take this chatbot to the next level by adding loops!

Loops allow us to perform some action repeatedly – such as placing an order for multiple drinks – without needing to write an excess amount of code. You’ll be doing this here! Write all your code in the file called **script.py** and run it by entering `python3 script.py` in the terminal.

Let’s get started!
